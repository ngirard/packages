This repository contains debian packages I built using [Nfpm](https://github.com/goreleaser/nfpm) on an Ubuntu 20.04 machine.

Most often I simply repackaged the published tarballs ; some packages needed compilation.

This is intended for personal use, and meant to be temporary replacements for upstream/official packages.
