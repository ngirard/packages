## TODO

- Navi: update (https://github.com/denisidoro/navi/releases)
- [ ] Xh: add symlink to `xhs` ([rationale](https://github.com/ducaale/xh#shorthand-form-for-urls))
- [ ] Xh: completion
- [ ] Ferret: the original project has been split (see https://github.com/MontFerret/ferret/issues/266). A bit confusing for me.
- [ ] Skim: update
